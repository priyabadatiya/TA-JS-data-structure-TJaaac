1. Write the output with reason

```js
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
};

let person2 = person;

person.firstName = 'Arya';

console.log(person2.firstName);  Arya (because person2 = person and person.firstName = 'Arya'.)
console.log(person.firstName);  Arya (because the value is copied by reference.)
console.log(person.lastName);  Doe (beacause given lastName: 'Doe'.)
console.log(person == person2); true (they have the same address.)
console.log(person === person2); true (they have the same address and data type.)
console.log(person.lastName === person2.lastName); true  (they have the same address and data type.)
```

2. Write the output with reason:

```js
let person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  address: {
    street: 'North 1st',
    city: 'San Jose',
    state: 'CA',
    country: 'USA',
  },
};

let personTwo = { ...person };

person.firstName = 'Arya';
person.city = 'Navada';

console.log(personTwo.firstName); john(beacause its cloning the address are different.)
console.log(person.firstName); Arya(because  the has been changed to arya)
console.log(personTwo.lastName); doe(because given lastName: 'Doe'. )
console.log(person.firstName === personTwo.firstName); false(because the address and value  are completely different)
console.log(person == personTwo); false (becausethey have different memory address. )
console.log(person === personTwo); false (because have different memory address and values, datatypes.)
console.log(person.address === personTwo.address); true(because the value of address has been not changed.)
console.log(person.address == personTwo.address); true(because the value of address has been not changed.)
console.log(personTwo.address.city); sanJose(because the value stored in person is a memory location and the location is same for both the address for person and person2. )
console.log(person.address.city); sanJose (because the value stored in person is a memory location and the location is same for both the address for person and person2.)
console.log(person.address.city == personTwo.address.city);true (because the value of address is not changed)
```

3. Write the output with reason:

```js
let person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  address: {
    street: 'North 1st',
    city: 'San Jose',
    state: 'CA',
    country: 'USA',
  },
};

let personTwo = { ...person, address: { ...person.address } };

person.firstName = 'Arya';
person.city = 'Navada';

console.log(personTwo.firstName); john (because they have different memory address. )
console.log(person.firstName); Arya (because  they have different memory address. ))
console.log(personTwo.lastName); Doe(because the value has not been changed. )
console.log(person.firstName === personTwo.firstName); false (because they have different memory address. )
console.log(person == personTwo); false (because they have different memory address.)
console.log(person === personTwo); false (because they have different memory address.)
console.log(person.address === personTwo.address); false (because they have different memory address.)
console.log(person.address == personTwo.address); false (because  they have different memory address.)
console.log(personTwo.address.city); sanJose(because it had not changed the value of city inside address. )
console.log(person.address.city); sanJose(because)
console.log(person.address.city == personTwo.address.city); true

4. Clone the `blogs` variable into a new variable named `clonedBlogs`

```js
let blogs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Post #1',
    body: 'My first blog post',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Post #2',
    body: 'My second blog post',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: 'Post #3',
    body: 'My third blog post',
  },
];

;
```
let clonedBlogs = [
  {...blogs[0]},
{...blogs[1]},
{...blogs[2]}
];

5. Clone the `question` variable into a new variable named `questionClone`

```js
var questions = [
  {
    prompt: 'Why is the sky blue?',
    responses: [
      'Because the color blue was on sale at Wallmart',
      'Because blue is the prettiest color',
      'Because the air molecules difract blue light more than any other color',
    ],
  },
  {
    prompt: 'Why are leaves usually green?',
    responses: [
      'So green caterpillars can hide better.',
      'Because leaves can more easily make energy with green light',
      "Because leaves absorb red and blue light so it's green that is reflected",
    ],
  },
];

let questionClone = [
  {...questions[0].responses:
  ...question[0].responses
  }];
  {...questions[1].responses:
  ...question[1].responses
  }];
  ]

```

6. Clone the `allBlogs` variable into a new variable named `allBlogsClone`

```js
var allBlogs = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'Alamofire JSON Serialization',
  body: 'All about serialization in Alamofire...',
  author: {
    id: 1,
    fullName: 'Jeff Potter',
    username: 'jpotts18',
  },
  comments: [
    {
      id: 1,
      body: 'Thanks for the help Jeff, this saved me hours',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      body: 'Your welcome. I am happy to help!',
    },
  ],
};

let allBlogsClone = {
  ...allBlogs,
  author:{
    ...allBlogs.author
  }, 
  comments:{
    {...allBlogs.comments[0],
    {...allBlogs.comments[1]
  ]
}
 
```

7. Clone the `person` variable into a new variable named `clonedPerson`

```js
let person = [
  {
    input: { name: 'Ryan' },
    output: { name: 'Ryan' },
  },
  {
    input: { name: { first: 'Ryan', last: 'Haskell-Glatz' } },
    output: { firstName: 'Ryan', lastName: 'Haskell-Glatz' },
  },
  {
    input: { name: 'Ryan', age: 24 },
    output: { name: 'Ryan', age: 24 },
  },
  {
    input: {
      name: { first: 'Ryan', last: 'Haskell-Glatz' },
      birthday: { year: 1993, month: 'Nov' },
    },
    output: {
      firstName: 'Ryan',
      lastName: 'Haskell-Glatz',
      birthdayYear: 1993,
      birthdayMonth: 'Nov',
    },
  },
];

 let clonedPerson =JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
```

8. Write a function named `cloneObject` that accepts an object and returns the clone of the object

```js
function cloneObject(object) {
   return { ...object };
}

// Run the test below to check your function

let user = {
  name: 'John',
  house: 'Stark',
  sisters: ['Arya', 'Sansa'],
};
let cloned = cloneObject(user);

let person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  address: {
    street: 'North 1st',
    city: 'San Jose',
    state: 'CA',
    country: 'USA',
  },
};

let clonedPerson = cloneObject(user);

console.log(
  `The user object is ${
    user == cloned ? `not clone` : `cloned successfully üòÅüëë`
  }`
);
(The user object is cloned succesfully);
console.log(
  `The person object is ${
    person == clonedPerson ? `not clone` : `cloned successfully üòÅüëë`
  }`
);
(the person object is cloned succesfully);
```
